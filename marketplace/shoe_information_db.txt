releases with the Air Jordan 1 “Obsidian / University Blue”, now

been a cultural monument,
breaking barriers between the court and the streets. Jordan Brand has
continued to shed new light on this timeless silhouette and does so
with this release.
This AJ 1 features a similar design to the “UNC Patent” 1s that

shoe_2 = Shoe(name='adidas Yeezy Boost 350 V2 Semi Frozen Yellow', price='$438', date_posted='', description='The Semi Frozen Yellow adidas Yeezy Boost 350 V2 was rumored as early
as May of 2017-some blogs even claimed they would be mostly glow-inthe-dark-but it was when photos of Kanye West wearing them first
surfaced on the web later in the year that confirmed the release. This
colorway steps outside of the comfort zone of previous 350 Yeezy
sneaker releases, which have remained subtle and mostly neutral
primary colors and bright accents. The official colorway of the
'Frozen Yellow Yeezys' is actually Semi Frozen Yellow, Raw Steel and
Red and features both of adidas pinnacle technologies, Boost
cushioning and Primeknit sock-like upper. The hype for the yellow
colored Yeezys was pushed to the roof before launch as Kanye West
appeared with Kid Cudi and Takashi Murakami as 'Ye and Cudi toured the
iconic artist's studio on a trip to Tokyo. In addition, the rumors
throughout the sneaker world suggested the Frozen Yellow Yeezy would
be an extremely hard to get release. As expected, the Semi Frozen
Yellow was announced officially on November 13th, 2017 and released in
limited quantities on November 18th, 2017. Sizes of the adidas Yeezy
Boost 350 V2 Semi Frozen Yellow are available now.', user_id='')
